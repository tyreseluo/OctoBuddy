# AI in your app: OctoSense's assistant

English | [简体中文](AI-SERVICES.zh-CN.md)

How a script app built here can use the assistant inside OctoSense (the octos
agent kernel the shell runs), what works today, and what is planned. State as
of 2026-09-27: App Hub `main` `e8601b8`, OctoSense `main` `405139f` (which
pins App Hub `46d67e51` and octos `a6ea8505`). OctoSense `main` has since
moved to `89787ba` (octos `60cf96e6`, App Hub still `46d67e51`) and App Hub
`main` to `a72989f` (documentation only); the app-facing facts below were
re-checked there.

The later sections cover what is being built on top: an app's own agent
declared in its bundle, the tools it exposes, the system toolbox, publishing
to the glance screen, `sys.digest` cards, and News end to end. Each feature
there is marked **available** (merged on `main` of the repository named, and
usable as described) or **coming** (in an open pull request, named, or only
in an ADR: the shape shown may change before it lands, so do not build a
submission on it yet). Commands marked **✓ run** were run for this page on
2026-09-27 (macOS, Apple silicon); every other command is quoted from the
named source and marked not run.

> **Building an app needs no AI.** Nothing in this repository calls a model
> or needs an API key, and you may use any coding agent (Codex, Claude Code,
> Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, …) or none. This page is only about the
> assistant your *finished app* may ask for on the device.

## The short answer

**Today a store app cannot ask a model or the assistant anything on an
OctoSense device.** No OctoSense shell serves assistant requests to contained
apps, and `card-host` serves no host services at all. Build your app so it is
complete without AI.

| You try | What happens today |
| --- | --- |
| Declare `octos.turn.start` (and friends) and call it | The gate accepts the name. The call answers `no service answers "octos" on this device`, in `card-host` and in the OctoSense shells alike (verified in `card-host`, below). |
| Declare `model` and call `model.complete` | The gate accepts it (App Hub [#24](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Hub/pull/24), merged): a one-shot model call is **coming**. The OctoSense `model` service is a draft pull request ([OctoSense#95](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense/pull/95)), not merged, so the call answers `no service answers "model" on this device` (verified in `card-host`). See [Coming: one-shot model calls](#coming-one-shot-model-calls-model). |
| Declare `llm` | The gate accepts it, but the `llm` service manages the device's AI providers (it has no prompt method) and answers only `os.*` system apps: `llm is for OctoSense's own apps.` Do not request it. |
| Declare an `agent` in `manifest.json` | Admitted and clamped by the gate; **nothing runs it** ([An app's own agent](#an-apps-own-agent)). |
| Ship `tools.json`, `AGENT.md`, `skills/` | Admitted by App Hub `main`; **no shell loads them yet**, and the shells' older App Hub refuses a manifest with the new `agent` fields (see [Status at a glance](#status-at-a-glance)). |
| Call `glance.publish` | The service is on OctoSense `main` but answers only `os.*` apps until [OctoSense#86](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense/pull/86) lands ([Publishing to the glance screen](#publishing-to-the-glance-screen)). |
| Put a provider API key in the bundle | Never. No keys, tokens or passwords in an app ([AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md#rules-for-every-app)). |

A plain HTTPS API your app declares under `net` is just a web request, even
if a model runs behind it. The usual rules hold: no key or token in the
bundle, the host is listed, and your privacy text says what leaves the
device. It is not the device's assistant and uses none of the person's AI
providers.

## How the assistant is built

- **One octos kernel per shell.** The OctoSense desktop and Home (the phone
  shell) each run one kernel, started on first use. Android bundles it,
  OpenHarmony runs it in process, a desktop runs the binary named by
  `OCTOS_APP_CORE_BIN`, iOS has none.
- **AI providers** (a system app) is where the person picks models and types
  keys, on host-owned sheets. Keys stay in the platform's secret store; no
  app ever sees one.
- **App peers.** An app the host grants the assistant gets its own octos peer:
  private conversation contexts, workspace and memory
  (`app/<app>/acct-<hash>`), owned by the shell's system agent. The app gets a
  scoped service, never the kernel, a provider or a key.
- **Approvals are the person's, in the app that asked.** The system agent
  never approves for an app.

Today only **native modules** the shell's host policy grants get a peer, and
the shipped policy grants one: Rinx, the Matrix client (`Policy::shipped()`
in OctoSense `crates/ai-host/src/lib.rs`). Rinx's mini-app host in turn
serves the `octos.*` names to the mini-apps a person imports into Rinx. A
contained script app installed through the App Hub gets none: the gate
admits the names, but no OctoSense shell registers an `octos` host service,
so its calls answer `no service answers "octos"`. Script apps get a peer in
the plan below.

## The assistant capabilities

Four exact names, each its own consent (`KNOWN_CAPABILITIES` in App Hub
`crates/app-policy/src/manifest.rs`; the names and their store lines in
`crates/app-policy/src/services.rs`). A prefix grants nothing:
`octos.` or `octos.admin` is refused by the gate.

| Capability | Call | Args | Answer (`r.data`) | The store says |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `octos.session.open` | `octos.session.open` | `{}` | `{open: true, model: {lane, provider, model} or nil}` | Open its own conversation with the assistant |
| `octos.session.history` | `octos.session.history` | `{}` | the conversation, `{session_id, messages: [...], …}` | Read its own conversations with the assistant |
| `octos.turn.start` | `octos.turn.start` | `{text}` (1 byte to 32 KiB) | `{turn_id, text}`, the reply, once the turn ends | Ask the assistant to work for it, using the device's AI settings |
| `octos.turn.interrupt` | `octos.turn.interrupt` | `{}` | stops the running turn | Stop assistant work it started |

The argument and answer shapes are those of the one host that serves these
names today, Rinx's mini-app host (`src/host/octos.rs` in
[hagency-org/Rinx](https://github.com/hagency-org/Rinx), over OctoSense's
`crates/app-peers`). Other arguments are refused (`Unsupported Octos
arguments`): an app supplies text, never a session, profile, provider, model
or approval decision. One turn runs at a time per app instance, and a turn
gives up after 180 s.

## A minimal call, and handling "unavailable"

`manifest.json` (only what a screen uses):

```json
"capabilities": ["octos.session.open", "octos.turn.start"]
```

`main.splash`:

```splash
fn ask(){
    ui.answer.set_text("Waiting for the assistant…")
    host.request("octos.session.open", {}, fn(s){
        if !s.is_ok {
            ui.answer.set_text("Assistant unavailable: " + s.error)
            return
        }
        host.request("octos.turn.start", {text: ui.prompt.text()}, fn(r){
            if r.is_ok { ui.answer.set_text(r.data.text) }
            else { ui.answer.set_text("Assistant unavailable: " + r.error) }
        })
    })
}
```

with `prompt := TextInput{…}`, `answer := Label{…}` and
`Button{text: "Ask the assistant" on_click: || ask()}` in the body.

- `host.has("octos.turn.start")` says whether the capability was **granted**,
  not whether any service answers it. Always handle `r.is_ok == false`.
- Treat "unavailable" as a normal state: no kernel on this device (iOS, a
  desktop without one), no provider configured, not granted, signed out.
  Show it in a sentence and keep every other screen working.
- Never ask the person for a key or a provider. The host's AI providers app
  owns that.

Verified on 2026-09-27 with `tools/octo run … --hidden` (App Hub `362d832`,
runtime `65d30a09`), clicking the button over the remote bridge:

| Manifest | The label read |
| --- | --- |
| `["octos.session.open", "octos.turn.start"]` | `Assistant unavailable: no service answers "octos" on this device` |
| `["storage"]` | `Assistant unavailable: this app was not granted "octos", which "octos.session.open" needs` |

The OctoSense shells run the same App Hub dispatch and register no `octos`
service either (they register `mail`, `llm`, `news` and `glance`), so a store
app hears the same `no service answers` there.

**Should you ship this today?** Only if the app is complete without it. A
reviewer asks about grants nothing on screen needs (`hub scan`), and every
`octos.*` line appears on the store's permission list. If you keep the call,
say in your listing and your report that it does nothing on today's devices.

## What the person sees

- **Before install**, one permission line per capability (the table above),
  and in the privacy summary: "Asks the device's assistant to work for it;
  the assistant's keys stay with the device." (with `octos.turn.start`), or
  "Opens or reads its own conversations with the device's assistant, but
  cannot ask it to work." (open or history only).
- **Keys and providers** only in AI providers, on host sheets: Start →
  Settings → AI providers on the desktop, OctoSense Settings → Accounts → AI
  providers on a phone.
- **Tool approvals** the assistant raises go to the person, in the app that
  asked, on the host's own controls (today that host is Rinx); the system
  agent never answers them. A script app cannot approve anything: no
  argument carries a decision.

## Errors

| `r.error` | Meaning | What your app does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `this app was not granted "octos", which "<service>" needs` | The manifest does not list that exact name | Add it to `capabilities`, or remove the call |
| `no service answers "octos" on this device` | This host does not serve the assistant to apps (today: every OctoSense shell and `card-host`) | Show "unavailable" and carry on |
| `no service answers "model" on this device` | No `model` service on this host (today: every OctoSense shell and `card-host`) | The same |
| `<code>: <sentence>` from `model.complete` (**coming**, OctoSense#95), `<code>` one of `capability`, `no_provider`, `rate`, `budget`, `bad_request`, `invalid_output`, `too_large`, `provider` | The `model` service refused the call ([details](#what-octosense95-adds-coming)) | Show the sentence; keep the app usable without the model |
| `Unsupported Octos arguments` | An argument other than `text` (turn start) or anything at all (the others) | Send only `{text}` or `{}` |
| `Provide text (at most 32 KiB)` | Empty or oversized prompt | Check before sending |
| `This app already has an assistant turn running` | One turn at a time | Disable the button while waiting, or interrupt first |
| `No assistant turn is running` | `octos.turn.interrupt` with nothing running | Nothing to do |
| Anything else (no provider configured, the provider failed, quota, signed out, revoked) | The host's text, passed through | Show it; never retry in a loop |

There is no per-app quota API. Budgets are the host's (planned, below).

## Test it

- **In the harness:** `tools/octo run <bundle> --hidden --port 8141`, drive
  the button over the remote bridge, read the label with `/snap`. Expect the
  `no service answers` state; screenshot it as your app's "unavailable"
  state.
- **In the OctoSense desktop:** rehearse the store path
  ([PUBLISHING §4](PUBLISHING.md#4-rehearse-the-store-path-locally)). To give
  the shell a kernel and a provider, see OctoSense
  [`docs/ai-services.md` § Run and test locally](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense/blob/main/docs/ai-services.md#run-and-test-locally);
  your app still hears `no service answers "octos"` there today.
- **The one host that answers today** is Rinx's mini-app host, for bundles a
  person imports into Rinx after review (a Matrix sign-in, Rinx's own
  assistant peer): [Rinx `examples/miniapps`](https://github.com/hagency-org/Rinx/tree/main/examples/miniapps).
  It is not the App Hub install path, and it refuses a bundle that declares
  an `agent`. Not re-run for this page.

## Coming: one-shot model calls (`model`)

App Hub `main` admits a second, narrower path
([App-Hub#24](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Hub/pull/24),
merged): the `model` capability, for the shell's `model` host service. As
App Hub describes it (the OctoSense service is
[OctoSense#95](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense/pull/95), a draft
that is not merged, so none of this runs yet):

- `host.request("model.complete", {task, input, schema, class}, fn(r){…})`,
  with `class` `fast` or `strong`. The host picks the model from the
  person's own AI providers; the app never sees the provider, model id or
  key.
- One shot: no tools, no memory, no history beyond `input`. The reply must
  validate against the app's JSON Schema (size-capped); URLs in the reply
  are refused unless the app asks for them. A per-app daily rate and token
  budget, kept by the host.
- The store says "Send what you give it to the AI provider you configured,
  within a daily budget"; the privacy summary says "Sends what you give it to
  the AI provider you configured, for one-off answers within a daily budget;
  it never sees your API keys."

Today the gate passes it (`grants: capabilities {"model"}`) and every call
answers `no service answers "model" on this device` (run in `card-host` at
App Hub `e8601b8`). The shells' pinned App Hub (`46d67e51`) does not know the
name, so today's shells refuse a manifest that requests it; the pin moves to
an App Hub with `model` in
[OctoSense#70](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense/pull/70) (open).

### What OctoSense#95 adds (coming)

The service in #95 (`apps/ai-providers/host-service/src/complete/`, crate
`octosense-llm-service`, registered by `crates/ai-host` next to `llm`) fixes
the shape. It is a draft and may change before it lands; do not ship a
submission that depends on it yet. It also adds ADR 0002 §14, "Direct
one-shot model calls", which keeps an app's own agent (below) the main path
for anything with tools, research, memory or approvals.

| Method | Args | Answer (`r.data`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `model.complete` | `{task, input, schema, class?, allow_urls?}` | `{output, meta: {class, requested, attempts, usage: {input_tokens, output_tokens, estimated}, budget}}` |
| `model.budget` | – | the caller's `budget` alone |

- **`task`** (at most 4 KiB) says what to do; **`input`** (any JSON, at most
  32 KiB) is what to do it on, sent as data the model is told not to obey.
- **`class`**: `"fast"` (the default) or `"strong"`. The host tries the
  person's providers in their own order, those of that class first, and
  passes over one that fails. `meta.class` says which class answered. The
  app never sees the provider, the model id or the key.
- **`schema` is required** (a bounded JSON Schema subset, at most 8 KiB);
  `output` always validates against it. A reply that is not JSON, fails the
  schema, carries a URL or is over 16 KiB is retried once, then refused.
- **No URLs by default**: a reply with `http://`, `https://` or `www.` in it
  is refused, because replies end up as card data. Pass `allow_urls: true`
  only when the app extracts links.
- **A per-app budget**, kept by the host outside the app's jail: by default
  6 calls a minute, and 100 calls and 100,000 tokens a UTC day. `meta.budget`
  and `model.budget` report `{calls_today, calls_per_day, tokens_today,
  tokens_per_day, tokens_left, per_minute, resets_at}`.
- **Refusals** are `"<code>: <sentence>"`, with `code` one of `capability`,
  `no_provider`, `rate`, `budget`, `bad_request`, `invalid_output`,
  `too_large` or `provider`. The sentence may be shown to the person.
- The service also checks the app's own manifest for `model`, behind the
  Card runner's gate.

A call as #95 shapes it (not run: no shell serves `model` yet; the literal
syntax follows the Photos bundle, space-separated lists and maps):

```splash
host.request("model.complete", {
    task: "Give the note a short title and up to three tags."
    input: {note: note_text}
    schema: {type: "object" required: ["title" "tags"] additionalProperties: false
             properties: {title: {type: "string" maxLength: 40}
                          tags: {type: "array" maxItems: 3 items: {type: "string"}}}}
    class: "fast"
}, fn(r){
    if !r.is_ok { ui.status.set_text(r.error) return }   // "budget: …", "no_provider: …"
    show_title(r.data.output.title)
})
```

In one line: today a store app can **declare** an agent that passes the gate,
but nothing in a shell runs it, calls its tools, calls a model for it or lets
it publish; the pieces that will are the open pull requests above.

What an app author can do today:

- Build the app's own screens so they are complete without AI, and show
  "unavailable" as a normal state.
- Declare an agent (`agent`, `tools.json`, `AGENT.md`, skills) that passes
  `hub check` on App Hub `main`, knowing no shell runs it yet (and that
  today's shells refuse its manifest; see below).
- Write and render L0 cards with `card-studio`, and design them around
  `sys.digest` once OctoScript#40 lands.

**Version skew to know about.** `tools/octo check` runs the App Hub checkout
beside this repository (`main`). The OctoSense shells still pin App Hub
`46d67e51`, which predates the `glance`, `news` and `model` capabilities and the new
`agent` fields (`model`, `background`, `triggers`, `instructions`, `skills`).
Manifests refuse unknown fields, so a bundle that uses any of them passes
`octo check` but is refused by today's shells. Leave them out of a bundle you
want to open in OctoSense now. Whether the shells' older App Hub admits a
bundle that carries `tools.json`, `AGENT.md` or `skills/` was not tested, and
nothing would use them there.

If you want to prepare, draft `tools.json` and `AGENT.md` outside `bundle/`,
from App Hub's News example
([`crates/app-policy/tests/fixtures/news-agent`](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Hub/tree/main/crates/app-policy/tests/fixtures/news-agent)).

## An app's own agent

**available** in the App Hub gate since
[App-Hub#18](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Hub/pull/18)
(merged 2026-09-27); **coming** everywhere else. OctoSense's shells pin an App
Hub from before #18, so their Card runner refuses these manifest fields as
unknown until the pin moves (OctoSense#86 moves it), and no shell installs
`AGENT.md` or skills into a peer, selects a model or fires a trigger yet (ADR
0002, Implementation step 2).

The contract is App Hub's
[PUBLISHING § The app's agent and tools](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Hub/blob/main/docs/PUBLISHING.md#the-apps-agent-and-tools);
the complete worked example is App Hub's
[`crates/app-policy/tests/fixtures/news-agent`](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Hub/tree/main/crates/app-policy/tests/fixtures/news-agent).

### The design (ADR 0002)

What OctoSense
[ADR 0002](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense/blob/main/docs/adr/0002-event-driven-app-agents.md)
(Proposed) decides for AI in apps, in brief:

| § | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Each app that asks gets its own agent (its app peer); the system agent supervises and never writes app agents' prompts. |
| 2 | Triggers belong to the app: a schedule, a data event from its host service, or the person in the app. |
| 3 | The app ships its agent: `AGENT.md`, skills, and model **requirements**; the host picks the model from the person's providers. |
| 4 | The app exposes typed tools (`tools.json`) with a risk level and a confirmation owner; the host registers them with the app's peer. |
| 5 | Collection is code (a data service, no model); judgement is the model's. |
| 6 | Searching, research and crawling are a system toolbox the host runs, granted per app with a scope. |
| 7 | Cards are L0, bound to host-resolved sources, rendered and critiqued before `glance.publish`. |
| 8 | The glance screen is curated by the system agent. |
| 9 | Memory is private to the app unless a rule or the person promotes it. |
| 10 | The person talks to the app's agent inside the app; approvals happen there. |
| 11 | The system agent tunes app agents with a versioned overlay; it never edits the pinned `AGENT.md`. |
| 12 | Script apps and native modules follow one model; only where rules are enforced differs. |
| 13 | Least privilege: tools, network, files, memory, secrets, risk, model, budgets, output, control. |
| 14 | A narrow, direct, one-shot model call for bounded jobs (`model.complete`, [above](#coming-one-shot-model-calls-model)); added in OctoSense#95, a draft. |

### The bundle

```text
bundle/
  manifest.json      "agent": { … } (below)
  tools.json         the app's own tools (next section)
  AGENT.md           named by agent.instructions
  skills/<name>/     SKILL.md + manifest.json, each named in agent.skills
  main.splash, listing.json, assets/, screenshots/  as for any app
```

Every file is under the bundle digest, so the agent that runs is the one that
was reviewed. Agent files without an `agent` in the manifest, and undeclared
`AGENT.md` or skill directories, are refused (App Hub
`crates/app-policy/src/agent.rs`).

### The manifest's `agent`

A store app's agent that passes the gate. **✓ run**: `tools/octo new --id
dev.example.brief <dir>`, then this `agent`, the `tools.json` of the next
section (plus a `brief.topics.get` read tool), `AGENT.md` and the skill
below, then `hub stamp <bundle>` and `hub check <bundle> --allow-unsigned`
with a `hub` built from App Hub `crates/` as on `main` `a72989f`:

```json
"capabilities": ["storage", "glance"],
"agent": {
  "profile": "read-only",
  "tools": [],
  "max_iterations": 6,
  "token_budget": 60000,
  "model": {
    "needs": ["tool_calling", "multilingual"],
    "tier": "standard",
    "local_only": false,
    "per_task": { "summary": { "needs": ["tool_calling", "reasoning"], "tier": "strong" } }
  },
  "background": true,
  "triggers": { "schedule": ["30 7 * * *"] },
  "instructions": "AGENT.md",
  "skills": ["morning-brief"]
}
```

```text
$ hub check <bundle> --allow-unsigned
  grants: capabilities {"glance", "storage"}, hosts {}, storage 16777216 bytes, agent read-only
```

(The only refusal was the template's missing screenshot, which a real capture
fixes.)

| Field | Rule (App Hub `manifest.rs`, `policy.rs`) | Enforced today |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `profile` | `read-only`, `workspace-write` or `workspace-write-never-ask`; there is no full access | gate |
| `tools` | generic host tools only: `ledger.read ledger.write net.fetch storage.read storage.write card.render`; anything else is refused | gate |
| `max_iterations`, `token_budget` | clamped to 8 and 200 000 | gate (`grants:` line) |
| `model.needs` | from `tool_calling vision long_context reasoning structured_output multilingual` | gate; the gate warns when an app has tools but no `tool_calling` |
| `model.tier` | `fast`, `standard` (default) or `strong` | gate |
| `model.local_only` | app-wide; data must not leave the person's devices | gate (shareable tools must say `private_data: false`) |
| `model.per_task` | named tasks `[a-z_]{1,32}`, at most 8, that `AGENT.md` refers to | gate |
| no provider or model name | an unknown key is refused: ``hub: manifest is not valid: unknown field `provider`, expected one of `needs`, `tier`, `local_only`, `per_task` `` (**✓ run**) | gate |
| `background` | a request to run while the app is closed; the person grants it per app; requires `triggers` | gate; the grant and the wake are **coming** |
| `triggers.schedule` | five-field cron, local time, at most 16 triggers | gate; firing is **coming** (ADR 0002 M3) |
| `triggers.events` | the app's own host-service events, in its namespace (`news.items.new`) | gate; delivery is **coming** (M3). A store app has no host service, so it has no events to name |
| `instructions`, `skills` | `AGENT.md` (text, 32 KB, no HTML scripts, no `#!`); skill names `[a-z0-9_-]{1,64}`, at most 16 | gate |

**The host picks the model**, from the person's providers, to meet `needs`
and `tier` (ADR 0002 §3, octos `peer/model/set`); policy may lower the tier
or force local models; the person may override per app. That selection is
**coming** (ADR 0002 step 2). How ties are broken is an open question in the
ADR.

### `AGENT.md` and skills

`AGENT.md` is the agent's role: what to do on each trigger, what matters in
the app's data, the rubric its output must meet, and its memory rules. A
skill is data only: `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` plus a `manifest.json` with
`name` (the directory), `version`, `description`, `uses` (each one of the
app's tools or in `agent.tools`; anything else is refused, **✓ run**) and
optionally `prompts.include`; `.md`, `.json` and `.txt` files only;
executable fields (`tools`, `binaries`, `mcp_servers`, `hooks`, …) are
refused.

```json
{
  "name": "morning-brief",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Write the short morning note from the followed topics.",
  "uses": ["brief.topics.get", "brief.note.save"]
}
```

### Approvals: `risk` and `confirm`

Declared per tool in `tools.json` (next section). Whether a call needs the
person comes from `risk`; whose surface asks comes from `confirm` (App Hub
PUBLISHING):

| `risk` | Runs |
| --- | --- |
| `read` (looks), `act` (changes the app's own state) | unattended |
| `destructive` (sends, posts, shares, buys, deletes) | only after the person approves |

| `risk: "destructive"` with | Person present | Person absent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `confirm: "host"` (default) | the host's approval path asks | an approval request in the app's conversation |
| `confirm: "app"` | the app's own confirmation sheet is the only confirmation | an approval request in the app's conversation |

`confirm: "app"` is allowed only for a tool with `implemented_by: "app"` (or a
native module's tool). The gate warns on every destructive tool; making the
example's `brief.note.save` destructive gives (**✓ run**):

```text
  [warning] tools: brief.note.save is destructive and marked background: in a background run it only becomes an approval request, and runs after the person approves
  [warning] agent: a background agent with destructive tools: each destructive call waits as an approval request until the person answers
  [warning] tools: brief.note.save is destructive: every call waits for the host's approval
```

The store shows the person one line per consequence, derived from the
manifest and `tools.json`, for example "Its assistant may work while the app
is closed, on a schedule; only if you allow it, and you can turn it off." and
"Can ask to mail.send: nothing of this runs until you approve it."

### What is enforced where

| Part | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Declarations (fields, sizes, names, schemas, risk, confirm) | **available**: the App Hub gate refuses or warns |
| The approval gate at run time (kernel); approve, edit or decline in the app's conversation | **coming**: octos#2567 (kernel side), ADR 0002 §10 / M7 (the shell's conversation) |
| In-app conversation with the app's agent | **coming**: ADR 0002 §10, M7; no pull request yet |
| Memory in `app/<app>/…`, promotion by rule | **coming**: ADR 0002 §9, M7. There is no manifest field; memory rules are prose in `AGENT.md` |
| Overlays by the system agent | **coming**: ADR 0002 §11, M8 |

## The app's tools and peer tools

What the app writes is **available** now: `tools.json` in the bundle, checked
by the App Hub gate (`crates/app-policy/src/agent.rs`):

```json
{
  "schema": 1,
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "brief.note.save",
      "description": "Save the morning note the app shows on its first screen.",
      "input_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": { "text": { "type": "string", "maxLength": 600 } },
        "required": ["text"],
        "additionalProperties": false
      },
      "output_schema": { "type": "object", "properties": { "saved": { "type": "boolean" } } },
      "risk": "act",
      "background": true,
      "implemented_by": "app"
    }
  ]
}
```

- `name` is `<namespace>.<tool>`; the namespace is the **last segment of the
  app id** (`dev.example.brief` → `brief`, `os.news` → `news`).
- `input_schema` and `output_schema` are both required (a tool without
  `output_schema` is refused: ``tools.json is not valid: missing field
  `output_schema` ``, **✓ run**). They use a JSON Schema subset (`type title
  description properties required items enum const default minimum maximum
  minLength maxLength minItems maxItems additionalProperties format
  pattern`); the input is an object. At most 64 tools, 1024-character
  descriptions.
- `implemented_by`: `host-service` (native code that holds data, network or
  secrets) or `app` (the app's script, for tools that only reshape its own
  data). How a call reaches a script app's own implementation is not
  specified yet.
- `background`, `shareable`, `private_data`, `confirm`: see
  [An app's own agent](#approvals-risk-and-confirm).

How the shell will hand them to the app's peer is **coming**:
[octos#2567](https://github.com/octos-org/octos/pull/2567) ("host-registered
tools per app peer with tool-list and risk enforcement", UPCR-2026-035),
draft, **changes requested** (the open point is whether credential binding,
octos#2556, must land first). The OctoSense side, the shell registering an
app's `tools.json` for its peer, has no pull request yet. Per #2567 (names
may change):

| Method | Direction | Shape |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `peer/tools/register` | host → kernel | `{session_id, peer, host_token, tools: [{name, description, input_schema, output_schema?, risk, background?, outward?, confirm?, shareable?}], generic_tools?, if_version?, call_timeout_ms?, approval_ttl_secs?, max_result_bytes?}` → `{…, version, tools: [{name, model_name, risk, background, outward, confirm}], applies: "next_turn"}`. The whole set replaces the previous one. |
| `peer/tool/call` | kernel → host | `{peer, session_id, context_id, turn_id, call_id, tool_call_id, args_digest, name, args, risk, confirm_required, timeout_ms, tools_version}` |
| `peer/tool/result` | host → kernel | `{session_id, peer, host_token, call_id, ok?, data?, error?, status?: "awaiting_confirmation"}` |
| `peer/tool/cancel` | kernel → host | `{call_id, reason: timeout \| cancelled}` |

The model sees `news.list` as `news_list`. Defaults: 30 s per call, results
at most 256 KiB, approvals expire after an hour. A gated call (destructive,
or outward) with `confirm: host` waits for a kernel approval; with
`confirm: app` and the person present it goes to the host with
`confirm_required: true`. The app never calls these methods: the shell
(`crates/ai-host`) does, for the app's peer (ADR 0002 §12).

## The system toolbox

**coming**: [OctoSense#82](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense/pull/82)
(draft, `crates/toolbox`, crate `octosense-toolbox`); "the shells do not link
it yet". The `research` and `crawl` capabilities do not exist in App Hub (the
gate refuses them: `policy: app dev.example.brief requests unknown capability
"research"`, **✓ run**), and `crawl` / `deep_crawl` is not implemented.

An app's agent never searches, crawls or drives a browser itself. It is
granted toolbox tools, and the host runs them outside the app, under the
app's scope and budget (ADR 0002 §6).

### Templates

Fixed, bounded OctoScript procedures with a manifest (parameters, the host
modules they call, a budget and an output schema), from #82's
`templates/*/template.json`:

| Template | Required params | Optional (default) | Budget: calls / model calls / pages |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `news-digest` | `topic`, `language` | `search_language` ("en"), `translate_query` (false), `limit` (3, 1–5), `max_age_hours` (72) | 8 / 2 / 7 |
| `topic-brief` | `topic`, `language`, `languages` (1–4 of `{language, translate}`) | `per_language` (3), `read_top` (4), `max_age_hours` (72) | 20 / 5 / 10 |
| `market-brief` | `symbols` (1–3 of `{symbol, name}`), `language` | `search_language`, `per_symbol` (2), `max_age_hours` (72) | 13 / 1 / 12 |
| `weather-plan` | `location`, `language` | `activity`, `days` (3), `search_language`, `limit` (2), `max_age_hours` (48) | 7 / 1 / 6 |
| `briefing` | `topics` (1–4), `language` | `search_language`, `per_topic` (2), `max_age_hours` (24) | 17 / 1 / 16 |
| `compare` | `subjects` (exactly 2), `aspect`, `language` | `search_language`, `per_subject` (2), `max_age_hours` (72) | 9 / 1 / 8 |

No template may exceed 64 calls, 8 model calls, 32 pages or 300 s; a run's
budget is further narrowed by the app's budget and its scope's `max_pages`.

### The tools

Per #82's `src/api.rs`, a call is tagged by tool name:

```json
{ "tool": "workflow.run",
  "arguments": { "id": "news-digest",
                 "params": { "topic": "electric cars", "language": "en" },
                 "run_id": "glance" } }
```

| Tool | Arguments | Answer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `workflow.list` | – | `{templates, refused?}` (the library plus the app's forks) |
| `workflow.run` | `{id, params, run_id?}` (`run_id` `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}`) | `{run_id, app_id, template: {id, version, digest}, status: ready \| partial \| failed, data, provenance, diagnostics, stats, trace, started_at, result_path?}` |
| `workflow.fork` | `{id, new_id?}` | `{template, path: "toolbox/templates/<id>"}`; the fork records its parent and may not add modules, raise a budget or turn provenance off |
| `workflow.evaluate` | `{a, b, cases}` (1–32 cases) | a comparison of two templates on the same inputs |

Errors are `{"error": {kind, message}}`, `kind` one of `manifest check
widening pin not_found not_granted params runtime io`. The agent reaches
these as peer tools ([previous section](#the-apps-tools-and-peer-tools)), not
through `host.request`.

### Scope, budgets, provenance

- **Scope** (`host.rs`): `languages, regions, allowed_domains,
  denied_domains, max_depth, max_pages, recency_hours`; the host refuses a
  call outside it. (`max_depth` is declared but unused in #82.)
- **The `research` module**: `query`, `search` (structured items), `article`
  (only ids found in this run; one page each; the text is hashed as
  evidence) and `digest` (a summary of at most 1200 characters and up to 12
  cited points).
- **Provenance is the host's**, never the model's: each source carries `id,
  url, title, source, language, published_at, retrieved_at, evidence_sha256,
  via`. A URL in the output that the host did not retrieve fails the run.
- **Results** are written to `<app folder>/toolbox/runs/<template>/<run_id>.json`.
- **One budget per app** is the plan: #95's `ModelHost::complete` is meant to
  be the entry the toolbox's model client shares, so template calls and
  direct `model.complete` calls draw on the same budget (**coming**, neither
  merged).

## Publishing to the glance screen

### `glance.publish`, `glance.withdraw`, `glance.list`

The service is **available** on OctoSense `main`
([#72](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense/pull/72),
`crates/shell/src/glance.rs`):

| Method | Args | Answer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `glance.publish` | `{card_id, source, data?, title, priority?, expires?, open?: {app, route?}}` | `{card_id, replaced, expires_at}` |
| `glance.withdraw` | `{card_id}` | `{withdrawn}` |
| `glance.list` | – | `[{card_id, title, priority, published_at, expires_at}]`, the caller's own cards only |

- `source` is an **L0 card** (L1 if its header declares it; L2 refused),
  realized against `data` (a map from the card's source names to values) and
  lowered through the Card runner's pipeline before it is stored.
- **Limits:** `card_id` 1–64 of `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`; `title` at most 80
  characters; `source` at most 16 KiB; `data` at most 32 KiB as JSON;
  `priority` 0–100 (default 50); `expires` 60 s to 7 days (default 24 h); 6
  publishes per minute per app (a replace, and a card the L0 check refuses,
  both count); 4 cards per app; 32 in the store; 6 shown.
- **Identity:** the publisher is the caller, never an argument; publishing
  the same `card_id` replaces the card; `open.app` must be the caller's own
  app. A tap opens that app. `open.route` is stored but not used yet.
- A tile runs in its own isolate with no capabilities and no hosts.

### Who may publish

- **On OctoSense `main` today: no contained store app can.** The service
  admits only `os.*` contained callers (`glance is open to system apps only
  until App Hub grants a glance capability`), the isolate refuses `glance.*`
  for any app whose manifest does not grant `glance`, and the App Hub the
  shells pin has no `glance` capability to grant. Native modules and the
  shell's demo (`OCTOSENSE_GLANCE_DEMO=1`) publish.
- **With [OctoSense#86](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense/pull/86)
  (coming):** the shells pin an App Hub with `glance` (merged there as
  [App-Hub#22](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Hub/pull/22)),
  and any contained app **granted `glance`** may publish, list and withdraw
  its own cards; system apps get no exemption. Refusal:
  `<app> was not granted the glance capability`.

Once #86 lands, a call from an app looks like this (the shape is
`glance.rs`'s; not run, since `card-host` registers no host services):

```splash
host.request("glance.publish", {
    card_id: "morning"
    title: "Morning brief"
    source: card_source
    data: {}
    expires: 43200
}, fn(r){
    if !r.is_ok { ui.status.set_text(r.error) }
})
```

Request `glance` only if the app publishes cards; the store shows "Show cards
on your glance screen".

## Cards bound to findings: `sys.digest`

**coming**: [OctoScript#40](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoScript/pull/40)
(the L0 source), [OctoScript-Makepad#50](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoScript-Makepad/pull/50)
(repin), [OctoSense#87](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense/pull/87)
(the shell resolves it, `crates/shell/src/glance_digest.rs`).

L0's no-facts rule forbids a card from stating findings as its own text, so
the findings become a source the host resolves:

```text
source brief sys.digest(app: "os.news", id: "glance",
                        fields: [topic, summary, points, sources, id, text, cite, n, title, source])
```

- `app` is a literal and must be the publishing app; the host refuses a card
  naming another. `id` is a literal (`[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}`, the toolbox's
  run-id charset) or a path into state.
- The record: `status` (`ready partial failed missing expired`), `topic`,
  `language`, `summary`, `retrieved_at`, `count`, `points` (`{id, text, label,
  cite, citations}`) and `sources` (`{id, n, title, source, url,
  published_at}`).
- **Links come only from `sources`**, which the host retrieved; text with a
  URL is dropped. A missing, expired or malformed digest resolves to an empty
  record with `$state` `.failed`, never an error, so the card shows its own
  "nothing yet" copy.
- In #87 the host reads the newest `toolbox/runs/<template>/<id>.json` for the
  app (under the host's directory, outside the app's jail), keeps only
  sources in the run's host-kept provenance, caps text (summary 800, 8 points
  of 400, 8 sources) and expires a digest 48 h after its run started; the
  card's expiry is at most the digest's.

The worked example is #87's `crates/shell/resources/glance/news-brief.card`:

```text
# ledger news.brief@1.0.0
# level:   L0
# profile: ui/l0

source brief sys.digest(app: "os.news", id: "glance",
                        fields: [topic, summary, points, sources,
                                 id, text, cite, n, title, source])

copy label   { class: vocabulary, en: "NEWS DIGEST", zh: "新闻摘要" }
copy nothing { class: vocabulary, en: "No digest yet. News will brief you after its next read.", zh: "暂无摘要。新闻读完下一批后会为你汇总。" }
copy sources { class: vocabulary, en: "SOURCES", zh: "来源" }

view root  Surface(pad: .page) {
             Col(gap: 6) {
               Row(gap: 8) {
                 TextCaption(text: copy.label, width: .fill)
                 TextCaption(text: brief.topic)
               }
               when brief.$state == .failed { TextBody(text: copy.nothing, width: .fill) }
               when brief.$state == .ready {
                 Col(gap: 6) {
                   TextBody(text: brief.summary, width: .fill)
                   for p in brief.points key p.id {
                     Row(gap: 8) {
                       TextRow(text: p.text, width: .fill)
                       TextCaption(text: p.cite)
                     }
                   }
                   TextCaption(text: copy.sources)
                   for s in brief.sources key s.id {
                     Row(gap: 8) {
                       TextCaption(text: s.n)
                       TextCaption(text: s.source)
                       TextCaption(text: s.title, width: .fill)
                     }
                   }
                 }
               }
             }
           }
```

(Its header comment is shortened here.) Until OctoScript#40 lands, the L0
checker does not know `sys.digest`, so a card using it is refused.

## Card levels and render-and-critique

The levels are defined in OctoScript's
[`docs/ui-profile-l0.md`](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoScript/blob/main/docs/ui-profile-l0.md):

| Level | What it admits | For AI output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **L0** | UI declarations only: data from catalogued `sys.*` sources the host resolves, no expressions, no calls | the default for generated and glance cards |
| **L1** | L0 plus arithmetic expressions, declared with a `# level: L1` header | only where arithmetic is needed |
| **L2** | imperative Splash (`ui.<id>.set_*`) | refused for generated cards; this is what a script app's `main.splash` is |

L0 card examples in this repository: [docs/l0/](l0/).

**Render and critique** (**available**, App Hub `main`, `crates/card-studio`;
the octos skill `skills/card-studio`, tools `card_render` and
`card_critique_payload`): render a card in a hidden `card-host --remote` at
the target sizes, run the measured checks (truncated text, does not fit,
failed source, lint, lowering), then build a vision-critique request against
a rubric. From App Hub's
[DEVELOPMENT.md](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Hub/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#inspecting-a-card-before-publishing-card-studio)
(not run for this page):

```sh
cargo build --release -p octosense-card-host -p octosense-card-studio
export CARD_STUDIO_KIT=../octoscript-makepad/components/l0
target/release/card-studio render --card news.card --data digest.json \
    --size glance --size phone --size desktop --out out/
target/release/card-studio critique --report out/report.json --rubric AGENT-rubric.md --inline > request.json
```

By hand, the same instrument: `card-host … --remote` (or
`MAKEPAD_REMOTE=<port>`), then `/snap` for widget text and rectangles, `/g`
for a frame grab (`/g?raw=1` for the PNG bytes), `/d` for the tree, `/log`,
and `/quit`. `tools/octo run --hidden` and `tools/octo shot` wrap this for a
bundle (README, [Headless testing](../README.md#headless-testing-many-apps-no-screen)).

Running the loop from an app's agent (ADR 0002 M6) is **coming**.

## End to end: News

News is ADR 0002's first slice. Each step, with where it stands:

| # | Step | Status | Where (OctoSense unless named) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **The data service collects**, no model: HN, TechMeme, Google News, RSS, followed topics (Google News, GDELT), a seen-items ledger, every 15 minutes | **available** (M1) | `apps/news/host-service`: `news.list`, `news.read`, `news.topics.get`, `news.topics.set`, `news.refresh`, `news.sources`, `news.feeds.import`; `os.*` only |
| 2 | **The bundle reads from it**: `host.has("news")`, then `news.list {feed, current: true, limit: 30}` | **coming**: News's manifest cannot request `news` until the shells' App Hub pin has it (#86); until then News fetches in its script | `apps/news/bundle/main.splash` |
| 3 | **A trigger wakes the agent**: the service's fetch report ("N new items") as `news.items.new`, or a schedule (`0 7 * * *`) | **coming** (M3): the service's `on_fetch` hook only logs today | `crates/shell/src/apps.rs` `register_news` |
| 4 | **News's agent runs**, with its `AGENT.md`, skills and tools declared in the bundle | declarations **available** in App Hub (#18); a peer for `os.news` and tool routing **coming** (M2, octos#2567) | App Hub `fixtures/news-agent` |
| 5 | **It runs the `news-digest` template**: `workflow.run {id: "news-digest", params: {topic, language}, run_id: "glance"}` | **coming** (M5, #82) | `crates/toolbox` |
| 6 | **The result is stored** by the host, with provenance: `toolbox/runs/news-digest/glance.json` | **coming** (#82) | `crates/toolbox/src/runner.rs` |
| 7 | **A card binds to it**: `news-brief.card`, `source brief sys.digest(app: "os.news", id: "glance", …)` | **coming** (OctoScript#40, OctoScript-Makepad#50, #87) | `crates/shell/src/glance_digest.rs` |
| 8 | **Render and critique** the card at glance, phone and desktop sizes | tool **available** (`card-studio`); run by the agent **coming** (M6) | App Hub `crates/card-studio` |
| 9 | **`glance.publish`** the card (`card_id` "brief", `data: {}`; the host fills `brief`) | service **available**; from a contained app **coming** (#86) | `crates/shell/src/glance.rs` |
| 10 | **The person taps it and News opens** | **available** (the desktop panel and the phone's glance page open the publishing app) | `glance_panel.rs`, `mobile_pages.rs` |

To see steps 9–10 today, run the desktop shell's own check, which publishes a
sample card as `os.news` at startup (`OCTOSENSE_GLANCE_DEMO=1`) and opens News
from it, hidden and driven over the remote instrument (from an OctoSense
checkout; not run for this page):

```sh
cargo build --release -p octosense && desktop/scripts/glance_remote.sh
```

## Testing without a provider

- **Run the app headless**, never with OS screenshots, as in
  [Test it](#test-it) and [QUICKSTART §4a](QUICKSTART.md#4a-headless-test-without-the-screen-several-apps-at-once).
  `card-host` registers no host services, so by the rule verified above for
  `octos` and `model`, a granted `glance.*` call there answers `no service
  answers "glance" on this device` and an ungranted one `this app was not
  granted "glance", which "glance.publish" needs` (not run for `glance`).
  Make every such call's error path visible in the UI, and exercise it.
- **Check the agent declarations** with the gate: `tools/octo check <bundle>`
  (`hub check`) validates `agent`, `tools.json`, `AGENT.md` and skills
  offline; no model is involved ([An app's own agent](#an-apps-own-agent),
  **✓ run** with `hub check`).
- **Cards:** render with `card-studio render --card … --data <fixture>.json`
  ([above](#card-levels-and-render-and-critique)): the data is a fixture, so
  no model or network is needed. For a `sys.digest` card, #87 ships a run
  fixture, `crates/shell/resources/glance/fixtures/news-digest-run.json`, and
  `OCTOSENSE_GLANCE_DEMO=digest` (**coming**).
- **Fakes in the platform's own tests**, for when you change a service or the
  toolbox (in OctoSense, not in an app bundle; the commands were not run for
  this page):

  | Piece | Fake | Status |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `model` service | a fake transport, `cargo test --locked -p octosense-llm-service --test complete` | **coming** (#95) |
  | Toolbox templates | `fixture::FakeModel` (deterministic, extractive; can inject a bad URL or citation) and `FixtureBackend`, with recorded cases in `templates/*/fixtures/`; `cargo test --locked -p octosense-toolbox` | **coming** (#82) |
  | `news` service | a fixture `Fetcher` and a moved clock; `cargo test -p octosense-news-service` ("fixtures, no network") | **available** |
  | `llm` service | a local fake provider endpoint (`fake_provider`), `FakeScanner`, `FakePicker`; `OCTOSENSE_LLM_VAULT=file` keeps keys out of the Keychain | **available** |
  | App peers | `tests/fixtures/mock_llm.py` (an OpenAI-compatible server that answers `ECHO: <text>`), a profile with `model_id: "mock-model"`; real-kernel tests run only with `OCTOS_APP_PEERS_TEST_KERNEL=<octos>` | **available** |
  | Kernel | `crates/kernel/tests/fixtures/fake_kernel.py` | **available** |

  An app bundle cannot swap in any of these; they are the platform's.
