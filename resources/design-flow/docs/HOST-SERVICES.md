# Host services

A contained app cannot open a socket to a mail server, hold a password or talk
to a device. When it needs that, it asks the shell: a **host service** does
the work in Rust, with what it holds, and hands back data, never the means.

[OctoSense-App-Hub](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Hub),
`widgets/src/splash_host.rs` and `splash_policy.rs` in OctoSense-org/makepad,
and the Mail service in
[OctoSense `apps/mail/host-service`](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense/tree/main/apps/mail/host-service).

## The services that exist

| Family | Service (source) | Who may call it | Shells that register it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mail` | Mail ([`apps/mail/host-service`](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense/tree/main/apps/mail/host-service)) | Any app granted `mail` | OctoSense desktop (`desktop/`) and Home (`phone/`) |
| `llm` | AI providers ([`apps/ai-providers/host-service`](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense/tree/main/apps/ai-providers/host-service)) | Only `os.*` system apps (the AI providers app); it refuses store apps even when granted `llm` (`llm is for OctoSense's own apps.`). It manages the assistant's providers; it has no prompt method | OctoSense desktop (`desktop/`) and Home (`phone/`) |
| `news` | News's data service ([`apps/news/host-service`](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense/tree/main/apps/news/host-service)) | Only `os.*` system apps; the `news` capability is on App Hub `main` but not in the shells' pinned App Hub yet | OctoSense desktop and Home |
| `glance` | The glance screen ([`crates/shell/src/glance.rs`](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense/blob/main/crates/shell/src/glance.rs)) | Only `os.*` contained apps until OctoSense [#86](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense/pull/86) lands; the `glance` capability is on App Hub `main` but not in the shells' pinned App Hub yet ([AI-SERVICES](AI-SERVICES.md#publishing-to-the-glance-screen)) | OctoSense desktop and Home |
| `model` | **None yet.** The `model` capability (one-shot `model.complete`) is on App Hub `main` (#24); the OctoSense service is [#95](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense/pull/95), a draft, so a call answers `no service answers "model" on this device` | – | – |
| `octos` | **None in OctoSense.** The four `octos.*` capabilities pass the gate, but no OctoSense shell registers a service for them: a call answers `no service answers "octos" on this device`. Rinx's mini-app host serves them to bundles imported into Rinx | – | – |

`card-host` registers none of these. The device's assistant and what an app
can and cannot do with it today: [AI-SERVICES](AI-SERVICES.md). A store app that needs something else needs a
new service in the shells (below), not a workaround in the bundle.

## Calling a service from an app

```splash
host.request("mail.accounts", {}, fn(r){
    if r.is_ok && r.data.len() > 0 {
        ui.address.set_text(r.data[0].address)
    } else {
        ui.note.set_text(r.error)
    }
})
```

- The service name is `<family>.<method>`. The family is a capability: the
  app's manifest must grant it (`"capabilities": ["mail"]`), or the isolate
  refuses the call before anything is queued: the callback runs at once with
  `r.is_ok` false and `r.error` = `this app was not granted "mail", which "mail.accounts" needs`
  (verified in `card-host`; the log shows `splash host: refused "mail.accounts": …`).
- `args` is any JSON-able value; it reaches the service as JSON.
- The callback runs later, on the UI thread, with `r.is_ok`, `r.data` (the
  service's JSON answer) and `r.error` (a string, when not ok). Exact shapes
  and refusal texts: [SCRIPT-API](SCRIPT-API.md#host-services-hostrequest).
- No service registered for the family on this shell: the callback gets
  `r.error` = `no service answers "<family>" on this device` rather than
  waiting forever.
- `card-host` registers **no** services (it has no dependency on Mail). A
  Mail-style app run in `card-host` gets that "no service answers" error
  (verified: `no service answers "mail" on this device`); the service is
  linked by the shell (OctoSense `desktop/` and `phone/`).

## The sheet

Some input only the person may give: a password, an account approval. A
service raises a **sheet** for it: a Splash program the shell draws over the
app, in an isolate of its own, under no app's policy. The app cannot open a
sheet; only a service can (`ServiceHost::open_sheet`).

The sheet calls the same `host.request`, and its calls arrive marked
`from_sheet`. The rule, enforced in `services::dispatch` before any service
sees the call:

> A method under `<family>.sheet.` is accepted **only from the sheet**. From
> an app it is refused with `<family>.sheet.<method> is for the host's sheet, not an app`
> (verified in `card-host`: `mail.sheet.submit is for the host's sheet, not an app`).

So a service takes a password only from its own sheet. Each opening starts a
fresh program (a password typed into a cancelled sign-in does not survive).

## Secrets are the host's

An app never collects a password, a PIN or a one-time code, not even to pass
it on:

- the runtime makes a password field inert in a policed isolate (see
  [SCRIPT-API](SCRIPT-API.md#gotchas));
- the gate refuses a bundle that declares one (`secrets` check in
  [PUBLISHING](PUBLISHING.md#2-the-rules-the-gate-enforces));
- the service that needs a credential asks for it on its sheet and keeps it
  in the platform's secret store (Mail: the keychain on Apple platforms, an
  Android Keystore key on Android), under the host's own directory, outside
  every app's jail.

If your app needs an account on some service, it needs a host service for it.
It does not get a login form.

## Mail, the worked example

The `mail` family (capability `mail`) as the Mail system app uses it
(`apps/mail/bundle/main.splash`):

| Method | Args | Answer (`r.data`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mail.accounts` | – | `[{id, address}]` this app may use |
| `mail.add_account` | – | `{id, address}` once the person signs in on the host's sheet |
| `mail.remove_account` | `{account}` | `{}` |
| `mail.folders` | `{account}` | `[{id, name, role}]`, the inbox first |
| `mail.sync` | `{account, folder?}` | `{new, total}` |
| `mail.list` | `{account, folder?, offset?, limit?}` | `{folder, total, messages: [{id, sender, address, subject, preview, time, unread}]}` |
| `mail.message` | `{account, folder?, message}` | `{id, sender, address, subject, body, html, attachments, date, time}` |
| `mail.mark_read` | `{account, folder?, message}` | `{}` |
| `mail.send` | `{account, to, subject, body}` | `{accepted}` |
| `mail.sheet.submit` | sign-in fields | sheet only |
| `mail.sheet.cancel` | – | sheet only |

The flow of `mail.add_account`: the app calls it and waits; the service
raises its sign-in sheet; the person types into the sheet; the sheet calls
`mail.sheet.submit`; the service tests the account, stores the password in
the vault and the account (without password) in `<host_dir>/mail/accounts.json`,
closes the sheet (`close_sheet_later`) and answers the app's original request
with `{id, address}`. Each account is granted to the apps that added it.

## Adding a new host service

A new service is a change to a shell, not to an app bundle. It needs, together:

1. **A capability** for its family in `KNOWN_CAPABILITIES`
   (`crates/app-policy/src/manifest.rs`), with its privacy line in
   `app-policy/src/listing.rs::privacy_summary` and its permission line in
   `app-hub/src/index.rs::permissions_summary` (a test there fails when a
   capability has no plain-words line). The list is closed on purpose; adding a
   name is a reviewed App Hub change.
2. **The service**, a Rust crate implementing `HostService`
   (`octosense_appstore::services`). A sketch (not compiled here; Mail's
   `lib.rs` is the complete, tested reference):

   ```rust
   use octosense_appstore::services::{HostService, Replier, ServiceCall, ServiceHost};

   struct Weather;
   impl HostService for Weather {
       fn family(&self) -> &'static str { "weather" }
       fn call(&mut self, call: ServiceCall, reply: Replier, host: &mut dyn ServiceHost) {
           match call.method() {
               "today" => reply.send(Ok(serde_json::json!({"temp": 21}))),
               other => reply.send(Err(format!("weather has no method {other:?}"))),
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   `call.app_id` is the calling app's manifest id (scope any state per app);
   `call.host_dir` is a directory only the host can reach (`<app data>/.host`
   in `card-host`, outside every jail); `reply` may be
   moved to a worker thread and `send` later; `host.open_sheet(splash_source)`
   / `host.close_sheet()` raise and drop the sheet (`close_sheet_later(app_id)`
   from a worker). Put anything that takes a secret under `sheet.`.
3. **Registration in the shell**: `register_host_service(Box::new(Weather))`
   at startup, where the shell's Card runner pumps `services::pump`. Mail's
   crate exposes `octosense_mail_service::register()`.
4. **Tests** in the service crate (Mail's run from a shell workspace that links
   it: in the ROM, `cd home && cargo test -p octosense-mail-service`).

Apps then declare the capability and call `host.request("weather.today", …)`.
