# Flow: script app from a text brief

Turn a written description of an app into a contained script app
(`main.splash`) that runs in `card-host`, passes the App Hub gate, and is
ready for the human publishing steps.

## Use when

- The input is text: what the app does, its screens, its data, who it is for.
- The app's behavior fits a contained isolate: its own storage, requests to
  declared hosts, and existing host services ([HOST-SERVICES](../../docs/HOST-SERVICES.md)).

Use another flow when the input is a design image or atlas
([image-to-card](../image-to-card/FLOW.md)), a Sketch file
([kits/sketch](../kits/sketch/FLOW.md)), or when the app needs new native code
or a new host service (that is a shell change, not a bundle). All flows:
[flows/README.md](../README.md).

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Brief | yes | Purpose, screens, actions, data sources, what is stored, error and empty states. |
| App id and name | yes | id `[a-z0-9.-]{1,64}`, not `os.*`. |
| Hosts the app will call | if any | Exact host names; each becomes `network.hosts`. |
| Publisher details | for publishing | Name, support contact, privacy-policy URL: **human** supplies them. |

## Prerequisites

```sh
tools/octo doctor        # pass: "[ok]" for python, hub and card-host, then "ready: …"
```

If it fails, follow its printed fix, or [QUICKSTART §1–2](../../docs/QUICKSTART.md#1-prerequisites).
A graphical session is required for step 5 onward.

## Steps

`A=<app dir>`, `B=$A/bundle`, `P=<port>` (for example 8141), `HUB=<the hub path tools/octo doctor prints>`.

| # | Do (exact command or action) | Pass when | Human? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Write the brief into `$A/BRIEF.md` (outside `bundle/`): screens, actions, data, states, hosts, capabilities you think it needs and why. | Every screen and action has a line; every capability has a reason. | Confirm the brief with the requester if it was ambiguous. |
| 2 | `tools/octo new $A --id <id> --name "<Name>"` | Prints `created …` and `bundle stamped`. | no |
| 3 | Edit `$B/manifest.json`: capabilities and `network.hosts` from the brief, nothing more ([CAPABILITIES](../../docs/CAPABILITIES.md)). | Every capability maps to a line of the brief. | no |
| 4 | Write `$B/main.splash` using only APIs in [SCRIPT-API](../../docs/SCRIPT-API.md) or found in the runtime source; start from the template's structure (state `let`s, `fn`s, `start_timeout(0.05, …)` loader, one root view). | File saved; no API used that you could not cite. | no |
| 5 | `tools/octo run $B --port $P --hidden --detach` (exits 1 if `$P` is taken: quit the old instance with the `curl … /quit` it prints) | Prints the `admitted` and `ready: first frame drawn` lines; `grep -nE '\[E\]\|splash:[0-9]+:\|refused\|on_render closure failed\|callback error' $A/.local-state/card-host.log` prints nothing after `[SPLASH] eval:` (do not grep for "error": healthy runs log Metal's `MTLCompilerError` in `[ui-hang]` lines). | no |
| 6 | `tools/octo shot $P /tmp/first.png` (right away is fine: `run --detach` returns once the UI is drawn, and `shot` waits for a settled frame), then open it. | The first screen of the brief is visibly drawn (not blank, not an error frame). | no |
| 7 | Drive every action in the brief: `curl -s "127.0.0.1:$P/click?x=&y=&wait=1"`, `curl -s "127.0.0.1:$P/t?t=…&wait=1"`, `/k?k=down&c=ReturnKey`; after each, a screenshot or `/snap?q=…` or the jail file under `$A/.local-state/<id>/`. Click a `TextInput` again before each `/t` (a button click takes its focus); screenshot pixels / 2 = click points on a Retina Mac. | Each action's effect is observed and recorded (command + what changed). | no |
| 8 | Test states: empty, error (e.g. network off or bad input), restart persistence (`curl -s 127.0.0.1:$P/quit`, rerun step 5). | Each state renders sensibly; stored data survives restart when the brief says so. | no |
| 9 | Fix and repeat 4–8 until all pass. | Steps 5–8 pass on one run. | no |
| 10 | Edit `$B/listing.json`: subtitle, description (what it does, truthfully), category, keywords, platforms tested, release notes. Leave publisher fields for the human if unknown. Replace `$B/assets/icon.svg`. | Listing parses (step 12) and says only what the app does. | Publisher name/support/privacy URL: **human**. |
| 11 | Drive the app to its best real state; `tools/octo shot $P $B/screenshots/01-main.png` (add `02-…png` for more screens, max 8, list them in `listing.json`); open each; `curl -s 127.0.0.1:$P/quit`. | Each PNG is a real capture you looked at. | no |
| 12 | `tools/octo check $B` | `<id> <version> — PASSED`, only the unsigned warning; no placeholder note (or placeholders are waiting on the human). | no |
| 13 | `"$HUB" scan $B --packet $A/build/review.json`, then write answers to its 7 questions into `$A/build/REVIEW-ANSWERS.md`. | Packet written; every question answered honestly. | no |
| 14 | Report (see [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md#reporting)): commands run and their results, screenshots, what was not verified. **Stop.** | Report delivered. | Hand-off to a human. |

## Outputs

- `$A/bundle/` — `manifest.json` (stamped), `listing.json`, `main.splash`,
  `assets/icon.svg`, `screenshots/*.png`: the submission candidate.
- `$A/BRIEF.md`, `$A/build/review.json`, `$A/build/REVIEW-ANSWERS.md`,
  `$A/AGENTS.md`: outside the bundle, not submitted.
- The `tools/octo check` output, verbatim.

## Hand-off

Continue with [docs/PUBLISHING.md](../../docs/PUBLISHING.md) from
§3.6: the publisher key, signing and the submission are **human** steps. An
agent drafts the submission text; a person signs and submits.
